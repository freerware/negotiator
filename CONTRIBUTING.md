# Working on `negotiator`

Looking to join us in evolving and improving `negotiator`? We put together a small guide to lay out the ground rules.

Let's do this! ðŸ¤“

## How do I report a bug?

Hey, nobody's perfect. As much as we test our code, a few bugs sneak past us. If you would like to report one you found, simply check our [Github issues](https://github.com/freerware/negotiator/issues) that have the `bug` tag to see if someone beat you to it! Otherwise, whip one up with [this](https://github.com/freerware/negotiator/issues/new?assignees=freerjm&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md) template.

## How do I ask questions?

Great question. We suggest checking for any Github issues with the `question` tag to see if anyone has asked the same question before. When you're not finding what you are looking for, we ask that you create an issue with the `question` tag, so that others can benefit from the conversation.

## Where can I leave feedback?

We would enjoy hearing your thoughts on the work we have done so far, how you use `negotiator`, and ideas you might have to make things better! Currently, just drop an email to the primary author at `freerware@gmail.com`.

## How do I contribute changes?

Want to lend us a hand? We welcome pull requests for fixes and new features! All we ask is that your pull request hits these checklist items:

- [ ] Uses [well formed commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- [ ] Includes unit tests and maintains consistent or higher code coverage.
- [ ] Makes changes to both comments and other documentation where appropriate.
- [ ] Uses the following pull request [template](https://github.com/freerware/negotiator/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md).
